    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Hello! My name is Santhush Wickramasinghe, but I go by "Sunny." The nickname stems from people frequently shortening my name without my consent. once, I was even called "Thushy," which was not a great experience.

    <p>
        I am originally from Sri Lanka but currently pursuing my studies at the University of Oklahoma. Before coming here, I completed the International Baccalaureate program in Hong Kong.
    </p>
    <p>
        Professionally, I work as a Business Intelligence Intern at American Fidelity and also as a Venture Capital Associate at the Ronnie K. Irani Center for Economic Growth.

    <p>
        Outside of work, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies and series, experimenting in the kitchen, and exploring various fitness activities from traditional strength training to light running.
